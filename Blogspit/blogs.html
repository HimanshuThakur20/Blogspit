              <h2>"A Good Human Being"</h2> 
              <br>
              In this busy, materialistic world or I should say, Kali-yug (name of fourth yug according to Hindu mythology) it has
              become really hard to find a good Human.
              <br>
              <br>
              “Who is a good human?”, “How to become a good human?”, “Whom we can admire as a good human?” most of us have pondered
              this question, at least once. Did we have a satisfactory answer? Not really! cause we all have different opinions and I
              think most of us are wrong.
              Then, how can we get right answers? So lets try to find it. In a very concise way, we can judge ourselves and ask our
              inner self before doing anything or saying anything to anyone. Whether it is a human or an animal. Every time ask
              yourself that “whatever I am doing will it hurt anyone?” But sometimes, in doing a good thing some wrong people get
              hurt. But it doesn’t mean that we don’t have any sympathy and respect for them.
              <br>
              <br>
              Now, if we think of traits of a good human being, what they could be? A good human ‘should have self-control over his
              emotions’ but it doesn’t mean that he cannot grief the demise of a loved one or someone. He should believe in love and
              forgiveness’, ‘always there to help others’; ‘respect for everyone’ not only elder, or only women or girls, but
              everyone. I feel in today’s world, one of the worst traits of human is being a hypocrite or having double stancards. So,
              a good, ideal human ‘should not be a hypocrite’, A person ‘should be down to earth’.
              <br>
              <br>
              Ever wondered, which is the most dangerous weapon? It is speech, yes it is speech. It can start wars, at the same time
              it can end them, we will talk about it some other day. So a good human ‘should have good control over his speech’. Even
              every one of us should mind whatever we say.
              <br>
              <br>
              And I think the best trait or moto a good human have is ”Karma is Dharma”, a good human being should put his work above
              everything. And this is also the key to success.
              <br>
              <br>
              If we talk about an example, to learn from someone, is none other than Lord Rama. Ever wondered, what is Ramayana, if it
              is a myth, a story, or ancient Indian history, what was its need? The Ramayana is only to find, who is a perfect man?
              All the values of Lord Rama were to tell us how to live a life, full of ethics and values. We get to how to respect our
              parents, our teachers, how to live with our siblings, the love and respect between a husband and wife, your devotion
              towards your work, spirituality, being down to earth, respect everyone even your enemy, the bonding between true
              friends, forgiveness, the realisation of your sins and many more. At the same time, it also shows the harsh truth of
              society.
              <br>
              <br>
              In the end, I can just say that the best way to know if you are doing right or wrong is self-realisation, listen to
              everyone then conclude something. So, from now every time before doing anything asks yourself, think about your parents
              your loved ones, they will be proud of you by doing this?
              
              So, are you a good human? Or even trying to be one?
